## Run in Development Mode

First, you'll need to make sure the `backend` is running so that API calls can be proxied to it. See [the backend's instructions for how to start its server](../backend).

To start the development server, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Choosing a specific port

To specify a port, set an environment variable `PORT` first:

```bash
export PORT=4000
```

In this case, the server will be launched on [port 4000](http://localhost:3000).

Alternatively, you can set your `PORT` environment variable in the `.env` file generated from [`.env.example`](./.env.example) after installation.

```bash
# .env file
PORT=4000
```

## Create Production Build

Build the package by running:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can then use the path to the production files as the public directory (or copy them over).

For use with express:

```javascript
import assets from 'toms-shuttles-frontend';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
// set express routes here
app.use(express.static(assets));
```
